        "MNIST (\"Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology\") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.\n",

We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare."

Gradient descent is a common optimization technique used to update the model's parameters in such a way that it minimizes the error between the model's predictions and the actual target values. It does this by calculating the gradient of a cost or loss function with respect to the model's parameters and updating them in the direction that reduces the loss."
